# World-Weather-Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to use the OpenWeatherMap to collect weather data in real time from around the world. Then, this information was plotted onto an interactive Google Map. Interactive apps were created where users could select certain weather conditions and have a list of possible travel destinations created. Users can also have a travel itinerary created with destinations that fit their desired weather parameters.
